#  todo use a text creator to put in the names of the files and then i think also have to use the os function to get any files that the user will use so it gets their txt files with the names and then can loop through them within the computer files and display them in history

import streamlit as st

st.title("AI Art")
st.subheader("History section")
st.info("Any images you created and saved will be able to be seen here again so you can view them for later use!")
